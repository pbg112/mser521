                Mental fitness should be prioritized as much as physical fitness. 
                <br>   <br>
                <br>Small, everyday practices like meditation, mindful tech use, and nutrition can boost brain health and emotional resilience.

                Image comes from results discussed on NPR podcast "This Is Your Brain on Religion" which discuses brain health intersecting religion and spirituality.
                According to author Newberg, many of the participants related that they were thinking more clearly and were better able to remember things after eight weeks of meditation. Remarkably, the new scans and memory tests confirmed their claims.

                Meditation offers a wide range of benefits for mental and emotional well-being, 
                and many of these effects can be traced to changes in the brain’s frontal lobe. <br>This is the region responsible for decision-making, 
                focus, emotional regulation, and problem-solving. Regular meditation has been shown to increase activity in the prefrontal cortex,
                 which helps improve attention span, impulse control, and the ability to manage stress.<br>
                 <p>By calming the mind and reducing the brain’s 
                 “fight-or-flight” responses, meditation supports clearer thinking and more balanced emotions. Over time, this practice strengthens neural pathways involved in concentration and self-awareness, making it easier to stay present 
                 and respond thoughtfully rather than react automatically.<br> Overall, meditation not only reduces stress and anxiety but also enhances frontal-lobe functioning, 
                 leading to better mental clarity, emotional stability, and healthier decision-making.</p>

            Another study from the Center of Disease Control (CDC) looks into the increase of self-reported anxiety in adults, and the results show that in the past 3 years,
        more and more adutls are reporting feelings of anxiety.
